# Redux Essentials Tutorial

This project contains the setup and code from the "Redux Essentials" tutorial in the Redux docs ( https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts ).

The [`tutorial-steps` branch](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-essentials-example-app/tree/tutorial-steps) from the original repo has the actual code commits from the tutorial. You can look at these to see how the official tutorial actually implements each piece of functionality along the way.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

> **Note**: If you are using Node 17, this project may not start correctly due to a known issue with Webpack and Node's OpenSSL changes, which causes an error message containing `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`.  
> You can work around this by setting a `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` environment variable before starting the dev server.
